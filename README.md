# RAG-based-Question-Answering-System
This project implements a RAG (Retriever-augmented Generation) based Question Answering System using the Transformers library from Hugging Face. It includes a Streamlit web interface for interacting with the model, allowing users to input questions and receive answers based on a custom knowledge base.
